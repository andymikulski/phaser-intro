Great, we have a rectangle. Let's make it move.

With Phaser, we simply need a reference to our game object in order to change it. We do not need to tell anything to render - Phaser will automatically pick up any changes the next time it renders.

Let's start updating this rectangle by moving it around the screen periodically. Again, we only need a reference to the object to make changes to what is displayed!
