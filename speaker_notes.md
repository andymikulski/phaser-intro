Let's abstract a little bit more code out of the `MyScene` class. This time we'll pull out the player tracking and put it into a class called `PlayerManager`. This will do nothing new; it'll still track players, add them to the scene, etc. We're just simply moving the responsibility out of our scene.

Voila! At this point we have two things: a PlayerEntity class with exposed utility functions, and a PlayerManager class responsible for handling incoming updates about players from the server.

This, in a nut shell, is what the Gather<->Phaser integration looks like. As updates come in from the game server, we have a PlayerManager class which checks who has joined, left, changed, and updates the PlayerEntity class accordingly. Objects are handled in a similar manner; on map updates, an ObjectManager kicks into gear and takes care of instantiating or removing objects from the world.
